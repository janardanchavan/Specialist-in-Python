Today's Topic: Integrating Python with Docker using API
- Revisiting Docker commands
-- Docker helps us to boot, install and login into the docker container within only 1 second
-- We need to download the os image and run the following command
` docker run -i -t --name myuos1 ubuntu:14.04
- apt-get is used to downlod the software, however it only works in ubuntu os.
- In redhat or centos 'yum' command in used instead of 'apt-get' command.
- use of dockerrun command - python to run commands for us.

```
import subprocess as sp

cmd = " docker run -i -t --name myuos1 ubuntu:14.04"

output = sp.getstatusoutput(cmd)

status = output[0]
out = output[1]

print(out)
```

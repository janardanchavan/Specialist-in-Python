Today's Topic: Integrating Python with Docker using API
- Revisiting Docker commands
-- Docker helps us to boot, install and login into the docker container within only 1 second
-- We need to download the os image and run the following command

` docker run -i -t --name myuos1 ubuntu:14.04`
- apt-get is used to downlod the software, however it only works in ubuntu os.
- In redhat or centos 'yum' command in used instead of 'apt-get' command.
- use of dockerrun command - python to run commands for us.

```
import subprocess as sp

cmd = " docker run -i -t --name myuos1 ubuntu:14.04"

output = sp.getstatusoutput(cmd)

status = output[0]
out = output[1]

print(out)
```

- note that using -i -t switches, docker takes you inside the newly created os
- stoping docker os

` docker stop myuos1`

- To run the os in the background: add -d switch, d stands for detach

`docker run -i -t --name myuos3 ubuntu:14.04`

- formatting variable output:

```
>>> x = 5
>>> y = 10
>>> print("This is {} and {} data.".format(x,y))
This is 5 and 10 data.
>>> print("This is {} and {} data.".format(y,x))
This is 10 and 5 data.
>>> print("This is {0} and {1} data.".format(x,y))
This is 5 and 10 data.
>>> print("This is {0} and {1} data.".format(y,x))
This is 10 and 5 data.
>>> print("This is {0} and {0} data.".format(x,y))
This is 5 and 5 data.
>>> print("This is {1} and {1} data.".format(x,y))
This is 10 and 10 data.
>>> print("This is {0} and {0} data.".format(x))
This is 5 and 5 data.
```

We can apply the same logic while working on the docker images:

```
import subprocess as sp

osname = input("Enter ur OS name" ")
cmd = "docker run -d -i -t ==name {0} ubuntu:14.04".format(osname)

output = sp.getstatusoutput(cmd)

status = output[0]
out = output[1]

print(status)
print(out)

if 
```

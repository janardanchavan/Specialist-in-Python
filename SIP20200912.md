Today's topic - echoback
- What is echoback - Whenever we type something at the command prompt, the programmer of the shell has applied additional command/functionality to typeback each character entered from the 
keyboard. For example, whenever user enters the data for input() command, we can see on the screen what data is being entered by user. This is known as echo back.
- Use of getpass function to bypass the echoback functionality.

Today's topic - echoback
- What is echoback - Whenever we type something at the command prompt, the programmer of the shell has applied additional command/functionality to typeback each character entered from the 
keyboard. For example, whenever user enters the data for input() command, we can see on the screen what data is being entered by user. This is known as echo back.
- Use of getpass function to bypass the echoback functionality.
- Whenever we enter any command, shell shows the result as well as it gives some exit code, 0 or non zero number. 0 stands for success i.e. the code has been executed successfully and any non zero number stand for failure i.e. the code is not successfully executed.
- Same exit code functionality exist in python code as well.

>>> import os
>>> os.system("date")
The current date is: 14-09-2020
Enter the new date: (dd-mm-yy)
0
>>> import subprocess
>>> subprocess.getoutput("date")

'The current date is: 14-09-2020 \nEnter the new date: (dd-mm-yy) '
>>> subprocess.getstatusoutput("date")

(0, 'The current date is: 14-09-2020 \nEnter the new date: (dd-mm-yy) ')
>>>

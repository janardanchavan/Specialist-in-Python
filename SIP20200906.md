In order to send the output to web browser from python, we need 'webbrowser' library.

Running/sending data to webbrowser from python
> webbrowser.open(<<web link>>)

Earlier we have used 'pyttsx3' to use computer speaker in python.
Now in order to connect mic of our system with python, we need 'pyaudio' library.
> conda install pyaudio

Once we have pyaudio library, we also need additional library to capture the speech we speak, called 'speechrecognition'
> pip install speachrecognition

save the Recognize() function in a variable, eg. r.
Capture the audio using 'listen' function of above variable.

In order to get the response in a text format, pass the captured audio to one of the google service:
> r.recognize_google(audio)

Further we can pass this output to our python program to run the application through these audio captured commands.
